## About this project

## Contribution Guidelines

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

# Contributing Templates

Once you successfully generate and test your template, you can share it with community. This can be done in three ways.

1. Create a pull request to [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureDevOpsDemoGenerator/)
1. Place the template zip file in any public repository and share the link in [Email](mailto:AzureDevOpsDemoGenerator@service.microsoft.com)
1. Share the template directly through email

> Note: If you have extensions installed in your organization, tempalte would be generated along with reference to all installed extensions in the ```Extensions.json``` file. You can edit this file and keep only the required extensions for the project. If extensions are not required, keep the file empty.

## Your template must contain following elements

We will communicate via Email once the template validated successfully.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Open an issue using the question template and the `question` label.  

The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the project team is available via handful of different channels.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in a workshop? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote


If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.  Please use the template for each issue.
